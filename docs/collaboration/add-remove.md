Adding and Removing Collaborators
Overview
In Devaito v2.0, collaboration is a key feature that allows multiple users to work on the same application or project. Collaborators can be added to your application to contribute to development, testing, or management tasks. This section guides you through the process of adding and removing collaborators, including best practices to ensure smooth teamwork.
Prerequisites

You must have an active Devaito account and be logged in.
You need to be the owner or have administrative permissions for the application to manage collaborators.
Ensure you have the email addresses or Devaito usernames of the collaborators you wish to add.

Adding a Collaborator
Follow these steps to add a collaborator to your application:

Navigate to Your Application:

Log in to your Devaito account and go to the "My Applications" section from the dashboard.
Select the application to which you want to add a collaborator.


Access Collaborator Management:

In the application’s settings, locate the "Collaborators" tab or section.
Click on the "Add Collaborator" button.


Enter Collaborator Details:

Input the collaborator’s Devaito username or email address.
Select the appropriate role for the collaborator (e.g., Developer, Tester, or Admin). Refer to Roles & Permissions for details on available roles.
Optionally, add a note or message to the invitation (e.g., "Please join our project for API development").


Send Invitation:

Click "Send Invitation" to notify the collaborator.
The collaborator will receive an email or in-platform notification with instructions to accept the invitation.


Verify Addition:

Once the collaborator accepts the invitation, they will appear in the "Collaborators" list with their assigned role.
You can verify their status in the application’s collaborator management panel.



Removing a Collaborator
If a collaborator no longer needs access to your application, you can remove them as follows:

Navigate to Collaborator Management:

Go to the "My Applications" section and select the relevant application.
Access the "Collaborators" tab.


Locate the Collaborator:

Find the collaborator in the list. You can use the search bar if the list is long.


Remove Access:

Click the "Remove" or "Revoke Access" button next to the collaborator’s name.
Confirm the action in the dialog box that appears. You may be prompted to provide a reason for removal (optional).


Verify Removal:

The collaborator will be removed from the application and will no longer have access to its resources.
Check the "Collaborators" list to ensure the user is no longer listed.



Best Practices

Role Assignment: Assign roles based on the collaborator’s responsibilities. Avoid granting Admin access unless necessary. See Team Best Practices for more guidance.
Communication: Inform collaborators about their roles and expectations before adding them to the project.
Regular Audits: Periodically review the collaborator list to ensure only active team members have access.
Secure Invitations: Use verified email addresses or usernames to prevent unauthorized access.

Troubleshooting

Invitation Not Received: Ask the collaborator to check their spam/junk folder or verify the email address used.
Permission Errors: Ensure you have administrative rights to add or remove collaborators. Contact Devaito support if issues persist.
Role Conflicts: If a collaborator cannot perform expected actions, verify their role in the Roles & Permissions section.
