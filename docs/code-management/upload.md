# Upload & Deployment Methods

## Overview

Currently, Devaito manages the deployment of mobile applications to the official app stores:

- **Google Play Store** (Android)
- **Apple App Store** (iOS)

## How Deployment Works

- As a developer, you build and prepare your application or plugin according to Devaito's requirements.
- You submit your project to the Devaito team (contact your Devaito administrator or support for the exact process).
- Devaito handles the publishing and deployment to Google Play and the Apple App Store for you.
- You do **not** need to manually upload your app to these stores.

## What You Should Do

1. **Prepare your project:**  
   Make sure your code is complete, tested, and meets Devaitoâ€™s guidelines.
2. **Contact Devaito:**  
   Reach out to the Devaito team or your platform administrator to submit your project for deployment.
3. **Follow up:**  
   Wait for confirmation and feedback from Devaito regarding the status of your app on the stores.

## Note

If Devaito provides API endpoints for uploading or managing your app in the future, this documentation will be updated with the relevant instructions.
