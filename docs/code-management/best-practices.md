## UI/UX Integration Best Practices for Devaito Plugins & Apps

When building a plugin or app for Devaito, it's important to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience within the Devaito interface (admin panel, widgets, etc.). Here are some best practices:

### 1. **Consistent Design**
- Match the look and feel of Devaito’s admin panel (colors, fonts, spacing).
- Use Devaito’s design tokens or style guide if available.

### 2. **Navigation**
- Integrate your plugin into the existing navigation (sidebar, top bar, or widget area).
- Avoid creating confusing or duplicate navigation elements.

### 3. **Responsive Layout**
- Make sure your plugin works well on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Use flexible grids and avoid fixed widths.

### 4. **Clear Actions**
- Use clear, descriptive labels for buttons and actions.
- Group related actions together and avoid clutter.

### 5. **Feedback & Loading States**
- Show loading indicators when fetching data.
- Display success and error messages for user actions.

### 6. **Accessibility**
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
- Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

### 7. **Minimal Permissions**
- Request only the permissions your plugin needs.
- Clearly explain to users why each permission is required.

### 8. **Integration Points**
- If Devaito provides extension points (widgets, modals, notifications), use them to embed your plugin natively.
- Avoid opening external windows unless necessary.

### 9. **Testing**
- Test your plugin in the Devaito admin panel before publishing.
- Get feedback from real users and iterate on the design.
