# Deleting / Archiving an Application

## Introduction
This section guides you on how to delete or archive an application on Devaito, ensuring these actions are performed securely and, when possible, reversibly.

## Steps to Archive
1. **Access Settings**: Open the application card and click on the management options (e.g., dropdown menu "...").
2. **Select Archive**: Choose "Archive" to pause the application without losing any data.
3. **Confirmation**: Confirm the action; the application will change to "Archived" status.
4. **Restoration**: To restore, find the archived application and select "Restore".

## Steps to Delete
1. **Access Settings**: Same procedure as for archiving.
2. **Select Delete**: Choose "Delete" for permanent removal.
3. **Confirmation**: Enter a confirmation (e.g., the application name) to prevent mistakes.
4. **Immediate Effect**: The application will be removed from your dashboard and all associated data will be erased.

## Important Points
- **Archiving vs Deletion**: Archiving is reversible and ideal for temporary projects; deletion is permanent.
- **Impact on Collaborators**: Collaborators will lose access when an application is deleted or archived.
- **Data**: Make sure to back up critical data before taking any action.

## Tips
- Use archiving to keep inactive projects without cluttering your dashboard.
- Double-check before deleting to avoid accidental data loss.
- See the "Version Management and History" section for backup options.
